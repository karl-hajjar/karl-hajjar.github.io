# About me
I am a PhD student under the supervision of [Lénaïc Chizat](https://lchizat.github.io/) and [Christophe Giraud](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~giraud/), working on a mathematical theory of deep neural networks. I mainly study the dynamics induced by gradient descent in the large-width limit to try to discover interesting properties that would shed light on why such models work so well in practice.
