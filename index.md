# About me
I am a 2nd year PhD student at [Laboratoire de Mathématiques d'Orsay](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/) under the supervision of [Lénaïc Chizat](https://lchizat.github.io/) and [Christophe Giraud](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~giraud/), working on a mathematical theory of deep neural networks. I mainly study the dynamics induced by gradient descent in the large-width limit to try to discover interesting properties that would shed light on why such models work so well in practice. I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique and completed my Masters in 2018 at Ecole Normale Supérieure. I worked two years in Berlin as a research engineer for Zalando before coming back to start my PhD.
